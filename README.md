# Platformer - MonoGame

This repo contains a simple MonoGame platformer. This is my first MonoGame so I'm sure there's better ways of making the same game but I've been following tutorials and shamelessly stealing code from a variety of sources.

### Progress

- Have a moving sprite
- User control via arrows
- Jump has gravity resistance
- Rolling on floor has friction
- Boundaries set to window size
- Bounce factor added to ball on floor and boundaries
